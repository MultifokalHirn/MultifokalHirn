### MultifokalHirn's GitHub Profile 👋

Hi, I am Lennard! I was born in Berlin and still live here _to this day_, working with the great people at [Signatrix](https://www.signatrix.com).

💻 During Covid, I worked on my own little dialectics tool called [superstructure](https://github.com/MultifokalHirn/superstructure), but for lack of collaborators I have halted work.
🌱 I’m currently hosting my own podcast and produce a ton of music, feel free to ask me about it!
🤔 I’m getting into the question of how to be a good tech lead
💬 After a while, most dicussions I have will end up with me declaring that again Hegel was right all along.
